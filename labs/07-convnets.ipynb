    "\n",
    "* \"Classical\" (\"Historical\") CNNs are a stack composed of two parts:\n",
    "  * a **convolutional** part, where have a cascade of convolutional layers intertwined with pooling layers for dimensionality and complexity reduction\n",
    "    * usually the filters in each convolutional layer are more numerous as the image size shrinks (i.e., as we get further from the input)\n",
    "  * a **fully-connected** part, where we have a sequence of few fully-connected layer, ending up in the output layer, where, as usual, we have as many neurons as there are categories\n",
    "  \n",
    " the epitome of the historical CNN (which is still used in research today nonetheless) is VGGNet (or simply VGG) [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556v6). Its *core* is a **convolutional block** composed of two or three convolutional layers each with the same number of filters, which is double the number of filters of the previous layer, up to 512 filters per layer. At the end of each block, there's a Max Pooling layer which halves the spatial dimension of the image.\n",

    "    3. it represents a \"rigid\" portion of the network in the sense that it constrains they size of the image to be fixed. We will see later how this can pose a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " Sometimes, even the pooling layers may get replaced by convolutional layers with large kernel size, as its effect is to reduce dimensionality (i.e., height and width) of the corresponding image.\n",

    "### Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning is the utilization of a model, built for a given task (**upstream task**) on one or more different tasks (**downstream task**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, in Deep Learning we operate a **model finetuning**, i.e., we use a model fully-trained on the upstream task and we adapt it someway on the downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning comes in different flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we might just re-use the model for the upstream task without re-training\n",
    "\n",
    "2. we might want to re-train the model on the downstream task leaving fixed the parameters of the majority of the layers, while re-training only the remaining parameters.\n",
    " Usually, we train only the weights in the final fully-connected layer. This method is called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. we might want to fully re-train the model, using the `state_dict` from the upstream task as an **initialization** for the training on the downstream task. This is the proper **fine-tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: if the ground truth for the downstream task and the upstream task have different domain (e.g. different number of categories), I'll need to modify the architecture of my CNN by **changing the number of output features** of the last layer. This, of course, will mean that the weights in this layer need to be re-initialized, hence, we'll for sure need to resort to strategies 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB2: a common techinque which is operated for **small downstream tasks datasets** is to obtain the features before classification (or, in principle, before any one of the layers of my CNN) and to operate feature extraction by fitting a **linear SVM** on top of these features (similar, in principle, to re-training on the last layer only, but with different loss). This approach has been shown to be much more robust to small dataset size.\n",

    "Deconvolution (*inverse convolution, transposed convolution*) is a process analogous to correlation. Usually, given a generic square matrix $M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ and kernel $K\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times k},~k<n$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M \\otimes K = L$, with $L\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(n-k+1)~\\times~(n-k+1)}$\n",

    "With the deconvolution we want to solve the \"inverse\" problem, i.e., given the same kernel $K$, from a smaller matrix $H$, obtain a larger matrix $N$.\n",

    "The architecture is a composition of two parts: a contracting module and an expanding module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contracting module is a sequence of VGG convolutional blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "After reaching the bottom part, we begin upsampling the image following the inverse of the scheme from the contracting module, with an additional operation: we concatenate the output of the upsampling with the output from the last convolutional layer of the corresponding block (as in the image). Thus, if the upsampling yields a 256-channel output, we concatenate this output with the output of the last 256-channel convolutional layer from the contracting module. This leaves us with a 512-channel tensor which we convolve to 256-channels once again. Note that, if the spatial dimensions of the data from the contracting module doesn't match those of the upsampled data, cropping is operated so that we can safely concatenate the two tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the original implementation of U-Net operates a semantic segmentation on a window which is approximately 2/3 of the original image (there will hence be a leftover band of pixels outside the center of the image). In the image below, the white thin lines represent the area that will be subject to the segmentation.\n",
